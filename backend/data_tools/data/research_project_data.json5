The contract will focus on developing content that facilitates streamlined, interoperable reporting to ACF. The contract will also conduct research and evaluation activities with states and tribal organizations to assess the effectiveness of providing these interoperability artifacts for these organizations to use. The ability to share data and develop interoperable data systems is important for effective operation and oversight of these programs. This contract is designed to address these requirements and deliver needed and practical tools to accelerate implementation of data sharing and interoperable initiatives.",

The primary objective of YDD, conducted for OPRE by Mathematica Policy Research and its partner, Chapin Hall Center for Children, was to develop a conceptual framework that could be applied to existing or new ACF programs to improve the well-being of at-risk youth and increase their ability to become self-sufficient adults and avoid long-term reliance on public assistance. These frameworks will inform ACF’s decisions about possible demonstrations and evaluations of innovative approaches to improving outcomes among youth at risk of not achieving self-sufficiency.",

Specifically, 1,000 mothers of infants with incomes below the federal poverty line have been recruited into the study and are receiving monthly cash payments by debit card for the first 52 months of the child's life. Parents in the experimental group are receiving $333 per month ($4,000 per year), whereas parents in the control group are receiving a nominal monthly payment of $20.

        The National African American Child and Family Research Center, supported by a five-year OPRE\
        grant (2021 — 2026), will provide national leadership and excellence by investigating the assets, needs,\
        and experiences of the diverse population of African American families and children served (or potentially\
        served) by ACF programs, as well as promising approaches to address economic and social inequities and,\
        ultimately, promote social and economic well-being.  The primary focus of this Center will be on childcare\
        assistance, TANF, and Head Start and Early Head Start programs and the populations they serve. The work of\
        the Center will draw on interdisciplinary approaches to accomplish the three goals listed below.\
        \n\n1. Advance Research\
        The Center will plan, initiate, and maintain a community-engaged, focused, and high-caliber research program.\
        The Center’s program of research will build on the existing literature related to African American children\
        and families and should be directly relevant to the needs and interests of ACF areas of programmatic concern.\
        \n\n2. Build Research Capacity\
        The Center will build research capacity and infrastructure to conduct research relevant to ACF program and\
        policy goals that is culturally rigorous and informed by an understanding of current and historical\
        circumstances that shape the experiences of African Americans. In addition, the Center will contribute to the\
        development and expansion of the pool of researchers reflective of the communities being studied by the Center.\
        \n\n3. Communicate Research\
        The Center will develop and implement a dissemination strategy that broadly and efficiently communicates\
        findings from research conducted within and outside of the Center and increases the use of research, data, and\
        relevant resources for a wide audience including researchers, federal and state policymakers, ACF grantees,\
        program administrators, and communities participating in the research.\
        \n\nThe Center is led by the Morehouse School of Medicine.\

        Leadership is widely recognized as an essential driver of organizational performance and improvement, but\
        little is known about its role in driving quality of early childhood programs and outcomes for staff and\
        families. In launching the Early Care and Education Leadership Study (ExCELS), the U.S. Department of Health\
        and Human Services’ Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) seeks to fill the definitional and\
        measurement gaps to help the early childhood field understand how effective leaders can improve quality\
        experiences for families in early care and education (ECE) settings.\
        \n\nOPRE contracted with Mathematica Policy Research and its subcontractor, the University of Massachusetts,\
        Boston, to conduct this study. The study team is identifying key leadership constructs, mapping out and testing\
        their associations to outcomes, and developing a short-form instrument to measure ECE leadership in\
        center-based settings. Project staff and OPRE will partner with substantive, technical, and practical experts\
        as well as a range of stakeholders from government agencies and leadership development programs to inform the\
        work. Project staff and OPRE will partner with substantive, technical, and practical experts as well as\
        seeking input and engagement with leadership development programs (e.g., ECE teaching staff, ECE directors)\
        as well as those from government agencies to inform the work.\
        \n\nThe goals of this multi-phase study are to:\
        \n\n\
        \n* Review the existing research literature to identify the key features of effective ECE leadership and\
        highlight gaps in our understanding\
        \n* Construct a theory of change that shows how ECE leaders can act as change agents for quality improvement\
        \n* Develop a compendium of existing measures aligned with the theory of change to identify measurement gaps\
        \n* Identify promising leadership quality improvement initiatives and methods of evaluating them\
        \n* Conduct a descriptive study in 100 centers that receive funding from Head Start or the Child Care and\
          Development Fund to test hypothesized associations between leadership constructs and outcomes in the\
          theory of change\

         Evidence suggests that fathers play an important role in children\'s development and that they can serve as\
         a key source of emotional and financial support. In many social services, however, fathers are overlooked.\
         This is the case in the child welfare system, where data from the Child and Family Service Reviews indicate\
         that fathers and paternal relatives are minimally engaged and may be untapped resources.\
         \n\nThe purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between what we know about the importance of fathers\
         and practices in the child welfare system that may contribute to low levels of father and paternal relative\
         engagement. Partnering with the Office of Family Assistance (which oversees the Healthy Marriage and\
         Responsible Fatherhood discretionary grant program) and the Children’s Bureau, this project aims to:\
         \n\n* Synthesize what we already know about a) efforts to engage fathers and paternal relatives of children\
         involved in the child welfare system, and b) Continuous Quality Improvement approaches within the child\
         welfare system;\
         \n* Map "touch points" within a child welfare case where fathers and/or paternal relatives could be more \
         fully engaged;\
         \n* Identify potential strategies and interventions that could be used at the touch points to increase their\
         engagement;\
         \n* Select a collaborative Continuous Quality Improvement approach and use it to work intensively with a few\
         sites to implement and test these father and paternal relative engagement strategies and interventions;\
         \n* Conduct a pilot study to examine the feasibility and implementation of the Continuous Quality Improvement\
         approach and the engagement strategies and interventions; and\
         \n* Conduct an evaluation of the selected continuous learning methodology and the engagement strategies and\
